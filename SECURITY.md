# Security Policy (In progress, I'll update this later)

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |

| < 4.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### If you find any security vulnerability you can create an issue in github. [Issue Link](https://github.com/Mohammad-Mesbaul-Haque/Markdown-Blog/issues)

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
